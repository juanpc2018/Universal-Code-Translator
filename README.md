## Universal Code Translator</p>

Proposal idea: </br>
Github is becoming a graveyard of dead code. </p>

a common problem across all linux builds and OSX.</br>
code is designed using Ubuntu 17, compiles & works, but only in Ubuntu 17.</br>
the same code becomes deprecated in 20.04.4 LTS,</br>
and super deprecated in 22.04 LTS</br>
similar OSX SnowLeopard, or OSX Mavericks, or OSX HighSierra or OSX Catalina</br>
when compiling on a different linux or OSX.</br>
gives errors about deprecated functions...</br>
you should replace "this" with "this"...read the manual.</br>
some code becomes broken and impossible to build. </br>
New code is Not backward compatible.</br>
its crazy you can crosscopile to different CPU arch & OS, but Not compile to the same OS & CPU.</p>

example:</br>
https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd/compare/master...juanpc2018:lbrycrd:master </p>

just 1 change, and becomes impossible to build. </br>
Boost Deletec 1 function, making the whole code useless. </p>

its too crazy to manually edit 10000 deprecated functions just to compile on a New OS,</br>
even with copy & paste is too much.</p>

Proposal to create a Code Translator</br>
like:</br>
bing translator</br>
google trasnlator</br>
yandex translator</br>
etc...</p>

instead of English to Russian or Chinese Traditional, or Chinese Simplified, or Spanish or Latin or Portuguese, or italian, etc...</br>
between source code versions, OS versions</br>
wxWidgets versions 3.1.6, 3.0.4, 2.8</p>

Input version code:</br>
[Ubuntu 17.04]</br>
Ouput:</br>
[Ubuntu 17.10]</br>
or</br>
20.04 LTS</br>
or 20.04.1 LTS</br>
or 20.04.2 LTS</br>
or 20.04.3 LTS</br>
or 20.04.4 LTS</br>
or 22.04 LTS</br>
or 18.04</br>
or 18.10</br>
or 20.04</br>
or 20.10</br>
or 10.10</br>
or 10.04</br>
http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/ </p>

translator for all deprecated functions automatically.</br>
Ubuntu 17 to 20,</br>
or 22 to 20</br>
or 17 to 16</br>
or 17 to 18</br>
18 to 20</br>
20 to 21</br>
21 to 22</br>
etc...</p>

to increase source code compatibility..</br>
a 100% perfect translation is impossble,</br>
but at least minimize the copy & paste.</p>

Most people Now are using Docks,</br>
i have used Docks and it was fun, </br>
was interesting & easy to have a snapshot in time of the OS the developer had, </br>
everybody can download and compile,</br>
BUT... that is Not moving forward.</br>
That is Not taking advantage of all the New OS improvements.</p>
That is cheating to compile on a New incompatible system like it was an old system.</br>
There is No real progress using docks.</br>
like accelerating the wheels in wet or oil floor, spins very fast, but does Not move forward...</br>
stuck in time.</p>

The "easy way" is to train A.I. for each OS version, Boost version, xgWidgets, GTK version, etc...
